<h2>Game About ðŸ“œ</h2>
<br>

This game is based on the popular mobile game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">`Wordle`</a> with a little bit of inspiration of Final Fantasy VI's attacking system for the boss battle.

Within the game, you will find that the forest world of the main character is being invaded by an evil wizard and the only way to save your world is to use *Magical Word Magic* to defeat the wizard!

One of the core factors in <i>Word Sorcerer</i> is the leaderboard. Using <a href="https://lootlocker.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwue6hBhBVEiwA9YTx8EQW2c-GlN_UVjrRAPVk0_OmgoPnOADHqUkqmBgvlgIe3FeFSEqXvhoCGpMQAvD_BwE">`Lootlocker's`</a> API system, we are able to manage a live server that will continue to update the leaderboard, giving the most recent results of players.
